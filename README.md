# 109a-final

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education at all levels, constraining educational opportunities for students around the world. As schools closed, teaching was undertaken remotely on digital platforms, making students’ access to technology and the internet ever more critical. In this project, we aim to gain deeper insights into the relationship between students’ internet connectivity and their success at school, measured by attendance rates, completion rates, and out-of-school rates for primary and secondary schools across the globe. Furthermore, we try to identify the most significant predictors of students’ success at school and develop models that best predict their success amid this unprecedented time.

This project uses Python, especially drawing from the Pandas library, and was created in collaboration with Sophia Cho, Bach Nguyen, and Jonathan Zhang. The final product was submitted as our final project to Harvard's Computer Science 109A: Data Science.
